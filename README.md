# Eric-Freeman-s-To-Do-List
Hello, this the finished and completed coding for my Cleveland Coding Program Project. For the most part I found that this project was quite comprehensible especially considering the vast amount of information available through Youtube and Codeacademy.com. This was my first project I've completed and I must say that Im so excited to take another step forward in my goal of becoming a developer! The most challenging part of this project hands down was #9, finding out where to implement the alert box. It took me a few hours of weeding through information and sorting out the usable and unusable before I finally came to the simple conclusion of using the "click on a close button" code and just added a window.alert task to it. For the most part this was very exciting and I can't wait to see what's next.
